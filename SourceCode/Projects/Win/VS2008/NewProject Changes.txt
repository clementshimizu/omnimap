1)I switched the build type to not register output, because it was failing, and not originally set.
2)Also I excluded the shader and lua resource files from the build because they weren't in the workspace as per our conversation.
3)i deleted the network code but not the files yet.
4)added a metadata container to the channels...
5)Switched runtime library from MT debug and release.dll to MT debug and release static linked
 <- is this a good idea?
6) fixed bug in property set useage
7) More meaningfull error log
 
 
 to do:
 mem leak check
 performance test
 add in lua and frag shaders
 redo lua and frag shaders
