<h2 style="text-align: center;">Release Notes for Release 2.4.0</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for Release 2.4.0</span><br>
<ol>
  <li>OmniMap version numbering system is changed. "2.4" is the version ".0" is the minor version.</li>

  <li>The water mark can be removed by registering Omnimap.  Please contact support@elumenati.com for more info.</li>

  <li>New update of OmniMap should be dll compatible with previous Omnimap Releases</li>

  <li>FEATURE REMOVED/BUG FIX: The windows registry is no longer used to set dome screen type.  Edit omnimap_user_edit.lua to change screens.</li>

  <li>CHANGE: 
<pre>
Newly compiled Omnimap will now default to look in the follow directories:

startup directory/OmniMapConfig/
startup directory/OmniMapConfig/Resources

startup directory/OmniMapD3DConfig/
startup directory/OmniMapD3DConfig/Resources

startup directory/OmniMapD3D10Config/
startup directory/OmniMapD3D10Config/Resources
</pre>

the resource directory used to be hard coded to look in  "c:\program files\elumenati\omnimap\..." so this needs a re-compile to benifit from this change.  If it is not recompiled, it may look in the elumenati/omnimap directory.  If your program crashes after upgrading OmniMap, check the log for where it is looking for its Lua files.<BR> Developers can change it if they want to, but otherwise omnimap will be configured on a per installation basis.  Another benifit is that you could create two directories, "SLAMMED DEMOS" and have all of your applications ready to go on a slammed unit, and "FULLDOME" and have everything configured for that...  and breaking one will not break the rest.</li>




  <li>Experimental integration with NAVGAR's Dome View. Please contact support@elumenati.com for more info.</li>
  <li>Poor looking triangle tessellation.  I "tweaked" the tessellation code to add more triangles around the edge of dome, and also also the bottom edge of slammed at the cost of removing some triangle density at the dome apex.  This should look much better. Feedback is welcome.</li>

  <li>BUG:  Since windows vista and windows 7, we can't write error logs to the program files directory during runtime.  To generate a log, run 

the application(for example demo.exe) with administrative privileges by right clicking on it and selecting "Run as administrator".  This will be 

fixed in a future minor release.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Release Notes for Release 2.0.3</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for Release 2.0.3</span><br>
<ol>
  <li>New dome screen tesselation eliminates rendering artifacts on
upper right and left hand sides of dome screen output.&nbsp; This new
dome tesselation is now the default dome screen.</li>
  <li>Support for OmniConfig, graphical configuration tool added.</li>
  <li>Added Elumenati logo to the off screen background of the output.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Known Problems in&nbsp; 2.0.0:</span><br>
1) Does not maintain source code compatibility with 1.x releases or
previous 2.0.0 betas.&nbsp;
Requires a recomplilation.<br>
2) There is not an OmniMapAppTextureD3D10 class yet.<br>
3) We can only guarantee that OmniMap works with NVIDIA grahics
hardware that has at least 128 MB of video memory.&nbsp; ATI hardware
has not been tested.<br>
4) OmniMapD3D10 only works on Windows Vista with graphics cards that
support DirectX 10, because DirectX 10 only works on such cards on
systems with Windows Vista.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for Release 2.0.0 </span><br>
<ol>
  <li>Added support for Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 10.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Support for loading external shader through a Lua parameter.</li>
  <li>Reorganization of Lua scripts for increased ease of use.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">OmniMapAppTextureD3D </span>and
    <span style="font-style: italic;">OmniMapChannelATD3D </span>classes
added for
applications that want to supply their own channel rendering&nbsp; in
D3D.</li>
  <li>Added support for panormic shaped screen class: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">OM_ToroidScreen</span>.&nbsp; To learn
more about screen shapes, see the OmniMap Configuration documentation.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added support for&nbsp; cylinder shaped screen class: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">OM_CylinderScreen</span>. To learn more
about screen shapes, see the OmniMap Configuration documentation.</li>
  <li>Alpha mask support added.</li>
  <li>Run-time extensible screen geometry support added.</li>
  <li>Numerous new convenience methods added to OmniMapBase for setting
and getting channel camera orientation and frustum values.&nbsp;
Includes removing access to OmniMapChannelBase::cam_info. All of the
information previously contained in this class can be accessed via the
new convenience methods.&nbsp; See the OmniMapChannelBase class for
more information.<br>
  </li>
  <li>OmniMapAppTextureOGL, and OmniMapChannelATOGL classes added for
applications that want to supply their own channel rendering.</li>
  <li>Added support for non-square non-power-of-2 channel
resolutions.&nbsp; Application programmes can now set an x and y
dimenstion for the channel rendering canvas.&nbsp; This is done in the
file OmniMapConfig/omnimap_dome_wiz_ai.lua.&nbsp; The line :</li>
  <dl>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> channelRes
= 1024</span></dd>
    <dd>has been replaced with :<br>
    </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">
channelResX = 1024</span></dd>
    <dd style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channelResY =
1024</dd>
  </dl>
  <li>To create a non-square window just set these values to the values
you
want to use.&nbsp; Non square windows are only supported in back buffer
and pbuffer rendering modes.(See #11)</li>
  <li>References to OpenGL have been removed from all base&nbsp;
classes.</li>
  <li>A new method for setting up the channel callbacks has been
added:<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; void
OmniMapBase::ForEachChannel(void
fun(OmniMapChannelBase *chan, void *userData), void *userData);</span><br>
This method allows the application developer to pass a void * to
the
channel rendering method.&nbsp; This can be a reference to an object or
data that is needed by the application for rendering.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Numerous bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Added a watermark that is the Elumenati logo.&nbsp; Please
contact Elumenati, LLC at 612-605-0826 or support@elumenati.com to have
the watermark removed.<br>
  </li>
