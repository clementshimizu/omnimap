<h1 style="text-align: center;">OmniMap API Real-Time Geometry
Correction Library</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Release Notes for Release 2.0.0 Beta 5</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Known Problems:</span><br>
1) Documentation for new convenience methods and new Lua configuration
scripts is not written.<br>
2) The API could change before the 2.0 release.&nbsp; Source
compatibility will be maintained but binary compatibility may not.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Change for Beta Release 2.0.0 beta 5</span><br>
1) Support for loading external shader through a Lua parameter.<br>
2) Reorganization of Lua scripts.<br>
3) More convenience methods for accessing channel parameters.<br>
4) OmniMapAppTextureD3D and OmniMapChannelATD3D classes added for
applications that want to supply their own channel rendering&nbsp; in
D3D.<br>
5) Built cylinder shaped screen class: OM_CylinderScreen, using
run-time extensible screen geometry support.<br>
6) Added support for triangle strips to run-time extensible screen
geometry.<br>
.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for Beta Release 2.0.0 beta 2</span><br>
1) Alpha mask support added.<br>
2) Run-time extensible screen geometry support added.<br>
3) Numerous new convenience methods added to OmniMapBase for setting
channel camera orientation and frustum values.<br>
4) Back buffer channel implementation added.<br>
5) OmniMapAppTextureOGL, and OmniMapChannelATOGL classes added for
applications that want to supply their own channel rendering.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for the 2.0.0 beta 1 release
include:</span><br>
1) Different handling of shader source files.<br>
2) Added support for non-square non-power-of-2 channel
resolutions.&nbsp; Application programmes can now set an x and y
dimenstion for the channel rendering canvas.&nbsp; This is done in the
file OmniMapConfig/omnimap_dome_wiz_ai.lua.&nbsp; The line:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channelRes = 1024<br>
has been replaced with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channelResX = 1024<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channelResY = 1024<br>
To create a non-square window just set these values to the values you
want to use.&nbsp; Non square windows are only supported in back buffer
and pbuffer rendering modes.(See #3)<br>
3) Added support for back buffer rendering.&nbsp; OmniMap now supports
applications rendering to the back buffer.&nbsp; In the file
OmniMapConfig/omnimap_dome_wiz_ai.lua, the line:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usefbo = true<br>
has been replaced by :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; renderTarget = RT_FRAME_BUFFER_OBJECT<br>
While "usefbo = true" will still cause the channel to be rendered into
a framebuffer object, applications can use pbuffers and back buffers as
well.&nbsp; To use pbuffers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usefbo = false<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renderTarget = RT_PBUFFER<br>
To use the back buffer:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usefbo = false<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renderTarget = RT_BACK_BUFFER<br>
When using the back buffer, OmniMap assumes that the application is
drawing to the back buffer, and does not reset the drawing target to
anything in OmniMapChannelBase::beginRenderToChannel.&nbsp; In
OmniMapChannelBase::endRenderToChannel, the back buffer is read into
the channel texture.<br>
4) References to OpenGL have been removed from all base&nbsp; classes.<br>
5) A new method for setting up the channel callbacks has been added:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void OmniMapBase::ForEachChannel(void
fun(OmniMapChannelBase *chan, void *userData), void *userData);<br>
This method allows the application developer to pass a void * to the
channel rendering method.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for the 1.0.1 release include:<br>
</span>1) Made a simple change to the shader to fix a crash on Nvidia
7900 GS Go Graphics.&nbsp; It is also a performance improvement.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes
for the 1.0.0 release include:</span><br>
1) Changed default for configuration parameter <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ConsolidateCameraIntoProjectionMatrix.&nbsp;
</span>It now defaults to <span style="font-style: italic;">true</span>.&nbsp;
<br>
2) Fixed a problem with the fragment shader that left some pixels
undefined in the final render phase on ATI hardware.<br>
3) Moved the methods <span style="font-style: italic;">ApplyProjectionMatrix
</span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">ApplyViewMatrix </span>to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">OmniMap_Channel</span> class
from the <span style="font-style: italic;">OmniMap_CameraInf</span>o
class.&nbsp; This was done so that <span style="font-style: italic;">OmniMap_CameraInfo</span>
did not have any OpenGL dependencies. <br>
4) Enabled pbuffer usage in offscreen channel rendering.&nbsp; The
usefbo option in the Lua configuration script omnimap_dome_wiz_ai.lua
can be set&nbsp; to false to use pbuffer instead of the default Frame
Buffer Object implementation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes for the 0.9.4 beta release
include:</span><br>
1)&nbsp; Disabled alpha blending during the post render phase.&nbsp;
The OpenGL state is pushed prior to disabling alpha blending, then
popped at the end of the post render phase.<br>
2)&nbsp; Disabled backface culling during rendering of heads-up display.<br>
3)&nbsp; Disabled the pushing and popping of the OpenGL state in
Omnimap_Channel::beginRenderToChannel, and
Omnimap_Channel::endRenderToChannel.&nbsp; There are applications that
change &nbsp;&nbsp; the state during rendering and expect it to stay
that way.<br>
4)&nbsp; Took a #include out of the fragment program used in the post
rendering phase.&nbsp;&nbsp; #include is not supported in GLSL fragment
programs on ATI cards. Now building the string&nbsp; that defines
the number of channels in memory and concatenating the rest of the
fragment program to it before compiling.&nbsp; <br>
5) Added a LUA parameter: "UseOmniMapMatrix".&nbsp; If set to false,
OmniMap does not modify the viewing or projection matrices for channel
rendering, and it is up to the calling application to set the proper
viewing and projection matrices.<br>
