A few notes

Check out the documenation
* Docs\BuildingOmniMap.pdf : how to build the dll from source code
* Docs\Omnimap_API_Integration.pdf : an integration guide (how to add the dll to a project)
* Docs\Omnimap_API_Configuration.pdf : how to configure settings
* Docs\ISVC_Omnimap_Perspective_Projection_Mapping.pdf : the research paper that describes the algorithm

An installer for the last release (a bit out of date) can be found here:
Packaged\installer\OmniMapAPI_2_0_3Final.zip

the rest of the packaged folder has the latest dll, header, and lua files
Packaged\


There are a few project solutions for various platforms, but you probabbly want to use:
OmniMap\src\Win32_BuildD3D\omnimapdllD3D.sln
Even though it says D3D it builds the dll that works in D3D and OpenGL for windows.

In the past when I do development work I will run the installer and then if I want to modify the DLL or LUA config files I will test it in the installed folder.
