Typical video projection systems display rectangular images on flat screens. Optical and perspective correction techniques must be employed to produce undistorted output on non-planar display surfaces. A two-pass algorithm, called projective perspective mapping, is a solution well suited for use with commodity graphics hardware. This algorithm is implemented in the OmniMap API providing an extensible, reusable C++ interface for porting 3D engines to wide field-of-view, non-planar displays. This API is shown to be easily integrated into a wide variety of 3D applications.
