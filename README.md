# Elumenati OmniMap Intro
Typical video projection systems display rectangular images on flat screens. Optical and perspective correction techniques must be employed to produce undistorted output on non-planar display surfaces. A two-pass algorithm, called projective perspective mapping, is a solution well suited for use with commodity graphics hardware. This algorithm is implemented in the OmniMap API providing an extensible, reusable C++ interface for porting 3D engines to wide field-of-view, non-planar displays. This API can be easily integrated into a wide variety of 3D applications.

# What version of Elumenati OmniMap/Omnity should I use? 
The Elumenati has created Projeciton Mapping plugins for a wide variety of situations.  To help you get on the correct track, we list a few options here:

* Unity3D based applications
    *   Use Elumenati Omnity that is availble on the Unity3D asset store
