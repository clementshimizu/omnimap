Well this is only my second attempt at doing anything opengl so theres
nothing too complicated here.

FEATURES:
        Fade in
	Fogging
	Looped music
	Lighting achieved by lit vertices
	Particle effects
	Moving space simulated by moving texture coordinates of a static quad
	Metallic door (simple sphere mapping)

	Map created using my own rather crude level editor
	Textures created using GIMP (free linux image editor)

When camera gets to the end of the tunnel its position is reset to the beginning 
of the map creating an seamless endless loop.

                     Thanks for watching my demo!
